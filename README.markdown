import debug
============

Start fancy debugger in a single statement.

People debug with `print`.  It's great in simple cases.  Another
debugging tool, [pdb][], is less popular as it requires more effort: one
has to do a Google search, skim through documentation, type some long
"trace... sth", and all of this only to get some unfriendly two-color
shell that doesn't even seem to understand how tab key should work.

This project FTFY: you `import debug` and you find yourself in a
debugger with syntax highlighting, tab completion, and readable `dir()`
alternative.  From there you can pretend you're just using interactive
console -- you don't have to know any `pdb` commands, just remember that
"c" closes debugger and goes back to your program.

(What really happens is that we simply start an [IPython][] debugger and
import [see][] for you.)

Put `import debug` right where you want to start debugging (it's like
[antigravity][]).
